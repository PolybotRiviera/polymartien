Repo of the robotics project, 2024 edition: Farming Mars,
from the Polytech Nice Sophia robotics team!
## Objectives
The purpose of the robot is to carry out several tasks in complete autonomy. The tasks to be performed are as follows:
- Pick up different types of plant

> Two fragile plants, one resistant plant

- Orienting solar panels

All the work must be completed within the allotted time and without colliding with the environment (walls, other robots, plants, pots).
